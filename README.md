## Dota 2 Lua package for [Atom](https://atom.io/)

### About this package

I'm very new to the modding scene, and also very new to atom packaging; so any suggestion/help is much appreciated and expected since there are a lot of flaws in my syntax (especially when it comes to indentation).

This package is a blatant port of the [Dota Lua package for Sublime Text](https://github.com/bhargavrpatel/Dota-2-Sublime-Packages). All credit should go to the author of that package, as this is mostly his work revised.

I have also used [this script](https://github.com/james2doyle/sublime-to-atom-snippets) to convert the code snippets.

Many thanks to the authors and I'm very sorry for any kind of copyright infringement as I am completely new to this.

**Note**: This package is mostly about snippets. For syntax highlight, consider installing the language-lua package.
 
### TODO

- [ ] Fixing indentation problems with snippets
